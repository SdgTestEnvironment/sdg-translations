status_blurb: 'The reporting status provides an overview of how many SDG indicators are reported on this platform.<br>
  If information is available for an indicator, it is marked as <span class="status complete"> Reported </span>. For other indicators, a suitable data source is still being sought; these
  can be identified by the <span class="status notstarted"> Not available </span> mark. If the time series for an indicator are currently being prepared for presentation on this platform, these indicators are
  marked <span class="status inprogress"> In progress </span>.<br>
  Time series for Germany are not available for all of the globally agreed indicators. There may be various reasons for this: Certain internationally relevant indicators
  cannot be meaningfully calculated for Germany or can only be answered in a global context. Such indicators are marked as <span class="status notapplicable"> Not applicable </span>.'
